  # Introduction
  The PK will expose some external API’s to interact with the module. Those
  API’s could be integrated in different ways (RESTful, RPC, Pub/Sub). In
  this section we will describe the RESTful interface as main reference.
  Additional definitions will be added posteriorly.

  The PK API will be the interface between the platform consumers and the
  underlying business logic implemented by the Keeper. The capabilities to
  implement are quite different and can be divided in independent domains.
  The service layer will organize the code in independent resources
  implementing the different business domains, encapsulating the complexity
  of those domains.

  The implementation of the RESTful API must be HATEOAS compliance. It means
  the requirement is to implement the Richardson Maturity Model Level 3.

  The most relevant domains and microservices to be implemented are

  * Actors RESTful API
  * Assets RESTful API
  * Curation RESTful API
  * Market RESTful API
  * Verification RESTful API
  * Search RESTful API
